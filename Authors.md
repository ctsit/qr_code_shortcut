# AUTHORS

The QR Code Shortcut module would not be possible without generous contributions from our authors and funders.

Christopher P Barnes, Director of the University of Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute, provides funding support for the UF CTSI REDCap team via UF CTSA Award and matching funds from the UF Office of Research.

We specifically want to thank our developers Tiago Bember tbembersimeao@ufl.edu, Marly Cormar marlycormar@ufl.edu, and Philip Chase pbc@ufl.edu for their contributions to the project.  Taryn Stoffs tls@ufl.edu provided valuable input into the design and testing of the Auto-Populate Fields module.
